Model description       : Yep... I based this model off Angelina Jolie from that Tomb Raider 			 		  movie.. ehh movie was okay... anyway I really tried to make the model 				  as realistic as possible.. I'm pretty proud of the skin which is where				  most the realism is.. The skins are all basically variations of each 			  		  other in some way... I kinda have a block on my imagination so... oh 			 		  well... comments what not, mail to nickelbag@nyc.com...
	
Big Ups			: Big ups to ocelot, the mighty pea... huge up to goatman... ahh feck, if 			  it's mad late and I wanna finish this thing up before I go to sleep so 			 	  if I missed anybody my fault..
